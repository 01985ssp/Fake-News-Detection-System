It can help users quickly verify news content before sharing it.

## Features
- Classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake**
- Text preprocessing: removes stopwords, punctuation, and tokenizes text
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
- Shows evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
2.Navigate into project folder :
cd fake-news-detection
